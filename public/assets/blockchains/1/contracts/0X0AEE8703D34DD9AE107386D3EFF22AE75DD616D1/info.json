    "description":  "Tranche is a decentralized protocol for managing risk. The protocol integrates with any interest accrual token, such as Compound\u0027s cTokens and AAVE\u0027s aTokens, to create two new interest bearing instruments, one with a fixed-rate, Tranche A, and one with a variable rate, Tranche B. The protocol is currently integrated with Compound and charges fees in Dai and ETH. Accrued fees are exchanged for SLICE tokens through UniSwap pools.",
